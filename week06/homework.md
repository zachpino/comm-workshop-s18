### Homework for 3/1

You have presentations to prepare this week, focus on those. But, please add the following features to your parameterized matrix from the exercises this week.

- A static dataset, pasted into your file, driving the radius of your circles
- Designed interaction and animations for mouseover, mouseout, and/or click events for your plotted circles

-----

For those of you that want a challenge!

Bonus: Can you define the specific quadrants, or meaningful regions of the plot? Could you draw those in and define them with text or color coding? Potentially on mouseover? You may need to react to the [user's mouse position](https://github.com/d3/d3-selection/blob/master/README.md#mouse).
