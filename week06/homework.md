### Homework for 3/8

Yes, not due next week! You have presentations to prepare instead this week, focus on those. 

In your presentation, though, please include examples of the data that you will use to produce each of the visualizations that you hope to draw. 

**For 3/8**, please add the following features to your parameterized matrix:

- Interaction and animations for mouseover, mouseout, and/or click events for your plotted circles
- Color scale for the plotted circles
- Buttons for data change to a different dataset, with transitional animations

Build out the page around the matrix, and try to contextualize the intended comparisons, expectected results, surprises, and specific learnings in some text and imagery.

For those of you that want a challenge!

Bonus: Add radius variation based on another static dataset
Bonus: Can you draw a [regression line / trend line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regression) (these are different things, but in a parameterized matrix they are often the same) into your visualization? How about a curve if appropriate? Don't bother with trying to do it programmatically, just plot the line or curve directly with the [`<polyline>`](https://www.w3schools.com/graphics/svg_polyline.asp) or [`<path>`](https://www.w3schools.com/graphics/svg_path.asp) svg elements.
