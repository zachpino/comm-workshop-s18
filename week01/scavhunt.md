### Scavenger Hunt
Get some experience working with the census API by attempting to answer these questions. Keep a record of your work by pasting the API query/queries you called along with the answers — feel free to add any explanations that helped your reach your determination as well.

All questions should reference the [2015 American Community Survey, **5 year** cadence](https://www.census.gov/data/developers/data-sets/acs-5year.2015.html). Check all results against your expectations — if the numbers seem off, do some quick secondary research and vetting. Some of these questions, especially those relating to funding, require research external to the Census API.

Don't cheat, but here is the [answer key](answers.md) to check your approaches to these questions!
