### Homework due 3/29

Complete the exercise for this week, if we do not make it through everything in class. This should all be familiar territory, so if you are feeling challenged, go back to previous weeks and review.

Consider starting on these Lynda.com tutorials if neededd...

- [CSS Grid Layout](https://www.lynda.com/CSS-tutorials/Welcome/622088/651299-4.html)
- [HTML Fundamentals](https://www.lynda.com/HTML-tutorials/HTML-Essential-Training/170427-2.html)

Additionally, as we are requesting *both a print and web instance of your project*, it will be necessary to convert your inDesign styles into much more reusable CSS styles. Start that work this week! 

There is no right way to make a *CSS style guide*, which is a simple HTML document demonstrating the different typographic and formatting rules that your end product will eventually follow. This will be a living document, updated whenever a need for communicating a new content type or context emerges.

For inspiration and ideas, take a look at some examples at [some examples](http://styleguides.io), this [pre-built template](https://hugeinc.github.io/styleguide/), and consider how a pay-for [web service](https://frontify.com/styleguide) handles style guides. You can also use [this service](http://stylifyme.com) to algorithmically pull a styleguide out of an existing websites.

To get started, consider styling *at least* the following elements for your project. The more constained and defined your guide, the easier your project will be later! Also, perhaps this is a moment to continue developing your iconography?

```html
	<html>

	<head>

		<style>

			/* Palette: ...  #*/

			h1 { 
				
			}

			h2 {
				
			}

			h3 {
				
			}

			h4 {
				
			}

			strong {
				
			}

			p {
				
			}

			.aside{
				
			}

			blockquote{
				
			}

			.button{
				
			}

			.button:hover{
				
			}

			ol{

			}

			ul{

			}

			ul li {

			}

			a{ 

			}

			a:visited{

			}

			a:hover{

			}
			
			hr{

			}

		</style>

	</head>

	<body>
			<!-- This is where you make some examples and use the samples from above, usually with lorem ipsum... -->
			
	</body>

	</html>

```
