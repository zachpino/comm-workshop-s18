### Homework due 4/6

Draw a choropleth with TIGER data! Please make use of something other than the national counties scope we used in class. Your choropleth could be counties per state, tracts per urban area, states per region... 

Make use of a chromatic scale to fill the geo boundaries depending on one of the scaled values that TIGER provides in the `properties` child array of each geo entity.

Screenshot and submit to blackboard.
