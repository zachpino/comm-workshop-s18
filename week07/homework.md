### Homework for 3/15

Yes, sorry, homework over break...

Please add the following features to your parameterized matrix:

- Color scale for the plotted circles
- Buttons for data change to a different dataset, with transitional animations

Build out the page around the matrix, and try to contextualize the intended comparisons, expectected results, surprises, and specific learnings in some text and imagery.


Additionally, *choose the simplest of the visualizations* that your story will require, *and build it*. Easy, right? 

We would recommend you begin with something we have covered: a bar chart, line plot, line chart, scatter plot, matrix. Use  real data!
