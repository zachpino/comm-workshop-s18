### Homework for 2/7/18

In addition to looking for your [dataset and story](dataset.md)...

Pull down a dataset from the Census API to answer this question:

#### How many people walk to work, circa 2015, in each state?

Use the lessons from this week to draw a horizontal barchart to answer this question. Post to Blackboard, along with your scavenger hunt examples.

	> Hint: You will need to divide the numbers in the dataset when drawing, as otherwise, the bars will be thousands of pixels tall! For instance `(d[i][1] / 2000`
	> Hint: Your svg container needs to be really wide to accomodate all the states!

Here are some other challenges to add sophistication and legibility to your chart.

	> Bonus: Can you use Javascript mathematical manipulation to draw population percentages rather than the number of people? (not pictured below)	
	> Bonus: Can you use Javascript mathematical manipulation to color the bars with their data too?
	> Bonus: Can you use label the bars with the abbreviated names of the states? Google 'javascript substring' for the necessary code.
