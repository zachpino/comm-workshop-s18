### Other Programmatic Visualization Resources

##### SVG Content

Make sure you take a look at what SVG can do! All of these can be implemented with simple `.append()` loops and configured with `.attr()` just like `circle` and `rect`.

##### D3 Utilities

There are also other D3 utilities that make certain kinds of imagery and plots much easier to pull off in SVG.

- [Symbols](https://github.com/d3/d3-shape#symbols)
- [Stacked Charts](https://github.com/d3/d3-shape#stacks)
- [Donut and Pie Charts](https://github.com/d3/d3-shape#arcs)
- [Area Plots](https://github.com/d3/d3-shape#areas)
- [Chords and Geodesics](https://github.com/d3/d3-chord)
- [Triangulation](https://github.com/d3/d3-voronoi)
- [Hatching and Pattern Fills](https://iros.github.io/patternfills/sample_d3.html)
- [Custom Color Scale](http://bl.ocks.org/jfreyre/b1882159636cc9e1283a)

##### Moving the Camera with Code

Often we want to control the zoom and pan position, rather than leaving that to the user.

- [Programmatic Geo-Zooming with Transition Control](https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/6242308)
- [Programmatic Zooming, not Geographic](https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/3892928)

##### All Kinds of Other Stuff

- [Mike Bostock's D3 examples](https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock) are always an excellent resource to browse
- The [Blocks](https://bl.ocks.org) D3 resource can be a bit spotty, but still remains as a great place to explore how different data visualizers approach common goals.
