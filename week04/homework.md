### Homework for 2/15/18

In addition to continuing to refine your [dataset and story](../week03/dataset.md)...

Pull down several datasets from the Census API that are related to your chosen topic space(s).

Use the lessons from this and last week to draw three charts, one per html page. Post these to Blackboard as a zipped folder containing all code and screenshots of the charts. Please use one meaningfully different dataset in each chart (even if it means stretching to adjacencies of your original questions) for practice working with a variety of real data. 

Ensure that these charts *look good* by settings `.attr` and `.style` on your elements. They should look at least as considered as this week's scatterplot example (a low bar to clear).

- One horizontal or vertical bar chart 
- One line chart 
- One scatter plot

Try to imagine which datapoints (in combination) might be a good match to each plot type. In addition, for each chart, try to articulate some specific learnings that the visualization manifests. Include this learning somewhere in the web page `<body>`.

Here are some other challenges to add sophistication to your chart.

- Bonus: Can you do all of these charts without any `for` loops?
- Bonus: Can your line chart have bubbles of different sizes to encode another datapoint? Can you use color scales to add another datapoint into the scatterplot? Could we draw several bars per element for internal and external comparison? In other words, try to add more dimensions than expected to each chart. 
- Bonus: Can the data you are plotting be more complex than just a mapped datapoint? Partitive percentages like we did with ambulatory disability percentages? Can we define our own synthesized datapoints from weighting and summing other datapoints?
