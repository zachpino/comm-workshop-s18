### Bonus Question from Last Week

As was asked last week â€” How many households who are *exclusively native american or alaskan native* have the broadband internet subscription necessary to access online native american language resources in each state? Are any of those numbers surprising? Is the percentage of native american households who can access that page smaller or larger than the entire population's equivalent percentage?

-----

To answer this question, we may want to look at the following data points for comparison.

- B28009C_004E: `Estimate!!Total!!Has a computer!!With a broadband Internet subscription` from the group `PRESENCE OF A COMPUTER AND TYPE OF INTERNET SUBSCRIPTION IN HOUSEHOLD (AMERICAN INDIAN AND ALASKA NATIVE ALONE)`

- B28009C_001E: `Estimate!!Total` of Native American Households

- B28002_004E: `Estimate!!Total!!With an Internet subscription!!Broadband of any type` from the group `PRESENCE AND TYPES OF INTERNET SUBSCRIPTIONS IN HOUSEHOLD`

- B28002_001E: `Estimate!!Total` of All Households
