### Homework due 4/12

*Due in-class on the 12th to share with the class informally. Also, upload zip to Blackboard by 9am on the 12th.*

- Create a choropleth tool that will help you research some aspect of your space...
- That uses census data to determine its color fill...
- That shows more than just a single datapoint (for example, it might show a differential between two timestamps, a percentage of the population rather than the raw person count, a calculated and/or weighted value, a result of a ranking algorithm)...
- That is somehow interactive, with clicking and/or hovering to expose additional or more precise data...
- With positioned text labels or symbols.

- Alternatively, if your core datasets are lon/lat points, visualize those points on a map instead of producing a choropleth. Otherwise, the same guidelines apply.
	
Some other goals to push your coding abilities further!

- Bonus: Animated?
- Bonus: Additionally add in a non-census dataset?
- Bonus: Allow the viewer to interactively switch the data points of the visualization?
- Bonus: Map census-data to non-TIGER shapefiles. [Data.gov has many](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset?tags=shapefile), though the internet has boundless resources as well.
